===================================

Overview
--------

Sail is a language for defining the instruction-set architecture
(ISA) semantics of processors: the architectural specification of the behaviour of machine instructions.
Sail is an engineer-friendly language, much like earlier vendor pseudocode, 
but more precisely defined and with tooling to support a wide range of use-cases.
Given a Sail ISA specification, the tool can:

- type-check it, to check e.g. that there are no unintended mismatches of bitvector lengths
- generate documentation snippets, using either LaTeX or AsciiDoc, that can be included directly in ISA documents
(see e.g. the [CHERI ISAv9](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-987.pdf#page=176) spec from p176 for CHERI RISC-V, the [CHERIoT](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2023/02/cheriot-63e11a4f1e629.pdf#page=91) spec from p91, and the [Sail AsciiDoctor documentation for RISC-V](https://github.com/Alasdair/asciidoctor-sail/blob/master/doc/built/sail_to_asciidoc.pdf))
- generate executable emulators, in C or OCaml, that can be used as an authoritative reference in sequential-code testing and for early software bring-up
- show specification coverage, of tests running in that generated C emulator
- generate versions of the ISA in the form needed by relaxed memory model tools, 
[isla-axiomatic](https://github.com/rems-project/isla)
and 
[RMEM](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/pes20/rmem), to compute the allowed behaviour of concurrent litmus tests with respect to architectural relaxed memory models, as an authoritative reference for the concurrency behaviour
- support automated instruction-sequence test generation from the specification in ways that get good specification coverage, using the [Isla](https://github.com/rems-project/isla) SMT-based symbolic evaluation engine for Sail
- generate theorem-prover-definition versions of the ISA specification, in Coq, Isabelle, or HOL4, that support interactive proof in those systems, e.g. that the ISA satisfies intended security properties, such as our [proofs for the Arm Morello ISA](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/morello-proofs-esop2022.pdf)
- (in progress) generate a reference ISA model in SystemVerilog, that can be used as a reference for hardware verification (e.g. using JasperGold)
- support interactive proof about sequential binary code, integrating the Isla symbolic evaluator and the Iris program logic in [Islaris](https://github.com/rems-project/islaris).

(Not all of these are currently supported for all models - check the current status as needed.)

![Sail overview](https://github.com/rems-project/sail/blob/sail2/etc/overview/overview-sail.png?raw=true)


The language is essentially a first-order imperative language, but
with lightweight dependent typing for numeric types and bitvector
lengths, which are automatically checked using the Z3 SMT solver.


Sail ISA Models
---------------

Sail has been used for Arm-A, Morello (CHERI-Arm), RISC-V, CHERI-RISC-V, CHERIoT, x86, CHERI x86, MIPS, CHERI-MIPS, and IBM Power.  In most cases these are full definitions (e.g. able to boot an OS in the Sail-generated emulator), but x86, CHERI x86 and IBM Power are core user-mode fragments, and the last is in an older legacy version of Sail. 

* [Sail Arm-A (from ASL)](https://github.com/rems-project/sail-arm).
These are complete ISA specifications for Armv9.4-A, Armv9.3-A, and Armv8.5-A,  automatically translated from the Arm-internal ASL reference (as used in the Arm reference manual). They are provided under a BSD 3-Clause Clear license, by agreement with Arm. 
The older  [Sail Armv8.3-A](https://github.com/rems-project/sail/tree/sail2/aarch64)
model, the "public" model described in our [POPL 2019 paper](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/pes20/sail/sail-popl2019.pdf), is still available but is largely superseded. 
There is also an older  [handwritten Sail Armv8-A ISA model](https://github.com/rems-project/sail/tree/sail2/aarch64_small)
     for a user-mode fragment.

* [Sail Morello (CHERI-Arm) (from ASL)](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/sail-morello), for the Arm Morello CHERI-enabled prototype architecture. This is similarly  automatically translated from the complete Arm-internal ASL definition.  It was the basis for our [Morello security proofs](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/sail-morello-proofs/blob/public/README.md).

* [Sail RISC-V](https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv). This has been adopted by the RISC-V Foundation.

* [Sail CHERI RISC-V](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/sail-cheri-riscv). This is the specification of the CHERI extensions to RISC-V, developed in the [CHERI](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/) project. 

* [Sail CHERIoT](https://github.com/microsoft/cheriot-sail). This is the Microsoft specification of their [CHERIoT](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/cheriot-rethinking-security-for-low-cost-embedded-systems/)  ISA design for small embedded cores with CHERI protection. 

* [Sail x86 (from ACL2)](https://github.com/rems-project/sail-x86-from-acl2). This is a version of the 
[X86isa](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~moore/acl2/manuals/current/manual/?topic=ACL2____X86ISA) formal model of a substantial part of the x86 ISA in ACL2, by Shilpi Goel, Warren A. Hunt, Jr., and Matt Kaufmann, automatically translated into Sail.

* [Sail MIPS and CHERI-MIPS](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/sail-cheri-mips). These are specifications of MIPS and CHERI MIPS developed in the first realisation of the CHERI architecture extensions in the [CHERI](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/) project.

* [Sail IBM POWER (from IBM XML)](https://github.com/rems-project/sail/tree/sail2/old/power).  This is a specification for a user-mode fragment of the IBM Power ISA, semi-automatically translated from their documentation; it is currently in a legacy version of Sail.

* [Sail x86 (legacy)](https://github.com/rems-project/sail/tree/sail2/old/x86). This is a handwritten user-mode fragment of x86, also in a legacy version of Sail. 

<!--

* [Sail 32-bit RISC-V model, partially handwritten and partially generated](https://github.com/thoughtpolice/rv32-sail). This currently implements a fragment of the machine mode (-M) specification for RV32IM. (Developed independently of the full RISC-V model for the REMS project.)

Example
-------

For example, below are excerpts from the Sail RISC-V specification defining the "ITYPE" instructions, for addition, subtraction, etc. 
First there is the assembly abstract syntax tree (AST) clause for the ITYPE instructions, that are parameterised on a 12-bit immediate value, the source and destination register IDs, and the integer operation:
```
union clause ast = ITYPE : (bits(12), regbits, regbits, iop)
```
then the definition of the encode/decode functions between 32-bit opcodes and the AST for these instructions: an `ITYPE` with immediate `imm`, source register `rs1`, destination register `rd`, and operation `op` is encoded as the bitvector concatenation on the right.
```
mapping clause encdec = ITYPE(imm, rs1, rd, op) <-> imm @ rs1 @ encdec_iop(op) @ rd @ 0b0010011
```
Finally the execution semantics for the ITYPE instructions defines how they behave in terms of architectural register reads and writes. This uses local immutable variables for clarity, e.g. `immext` is the sign-extended immediate value, of type `xlenbits`, which is a synonym for `xlen`-wide bitvectors.
```
function clause execute (ITYPE (imm, rs1, rd, op)) = {
  let rs1_val = X(rs1);                      // read the source register rs1
  let immext : xlenbits = EXTS(imm);         // sign-extend the immediate argument imm
  let result : xlenbits = match op {         // compute the result, case-splitting on op
    RISCV_ADDI  => rs1_val + immext,         // ...for ADDI, do a bitvector addition
    RISCV_SLTI  => EXTZ(rs1_val <_s immext), // ...etc
    RISCV_SLTIU => EXTZ(rs1_val <_u immext),
    RISCV_ANDI  => rs1_val & immext,
    RISCV_ORI   => rs1_val | immext,
    RISCV_XORI  => rs1_val ^ immext
  };
  X(rd) = result;                            // write the result to the destination register
  true                                       // successful termination
}
```


This repository
----------------

This repository contains the implementation of Sail, together with
some Sail specifications and related tools.

* A manual, [doc/manual.html](doc/manual.html) with source (in [doc/](doc/)), currently [available online here](https://alasdair.github.io/manual.html)

* The Sail source code (in [src/](src/))

* Generated Isabelle snapshots of some ISA models, in [snapshots/isabelle](snapshots/isabelle)

* Documentation for generating Isabelle and working with the ISA specs
  in Isabelle in [lib/isabelle/manual.pdf](lib/isabelle/manual.pdf)

* Simple emacs and VSCode modes with syntax highlighting (in [editors/](editors/))

* A test suite for Sail (in [test/](test/))

The support library for Coq models is in [a separate repository](https://github.com/rems-project/coq-sail) to help our package management.

RGen is an extension to the Sail language (<http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/>.). This repository is to be used in conjunction with <https://github.com/derekztu22/sail-riscv>. It adds functionality to Sail to allow it to generate artifacts for LLVM, QEMU, and PyTorch. Please make sure you are using the rgen branch when using RGen

Installation
------------

This repository follows the same installation process as the Sail repository (<https://github.com/rems-project/sail>).
See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for how
to install Sail using opam. Please make sure you are following the instructions to install the development version of Sail.


Editor support
--------------

**Emacs Mode**
[editors/sail-mode.el](editors/sail-mode.el) contains an Emacs mode
for the most recent version of Sail which provides some basic syntax
highlighting.

**VSCode Mode**
[editors/vscode](editors/vscode) contains a Visual Studio Code mode
which provides some basic syntax highlighting. It is also available
on the VSCode Marketplace.

**CLion/PyCharm Syntax highlighting**
[editors/vscode/sail](editors/vscode/sail) contains a Visual Studio Code
mode which provides some basic syntax highlighting. CLion/PyCharm can also
parse the [editors/vscode/sail/syntax/sail.tmLanguage.json](sail.tmLanguage.json)
file and use it to provide basic syntax highlighting.
